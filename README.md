# Muilessium

*Coming Soon...*

Muilessium is my little pet project. It is a UI framework or rather a collection of elements like buttons, breadcrumbs, tags, sliders, charts e.t.c. It has Bootstrap-like grid. It is assumed that this collection will be a good base for a new website. Well structured LESS code (I use RSCSS) allows to customize Muilessium very quickly. All colors are in one file, all global constants too. Documentation for components based on DSS parser and can be generated in real time using Grunt. It is very useful - We have an ability to create components separately and then integrate them into a  website. Most of  elements can work without Javascript, using only abilities of CSS3. ES6 code used only for some components and structured in separate classes for every component. In future I want to create something like constructor for this framework and add ability to add or remove components by one click. You can see the current status by cloning and building Muilessium by yourself.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/sfi0zy/muilessium.git
cd muilessium
npm i
grunt server
```

Also You can see some tests in collection on [CodePen](http://codepen.io/collection/DzBjdz/)
